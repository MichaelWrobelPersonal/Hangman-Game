# Technology Details

This is primarely a project emphasizing what can be accomplished programatically using Javascript.  The HTML and CSS is secondary in this project to the effort put into the actual gameplay.  JQuery is utilized for updates to HTML from Javascript.  Animation of the Hangman is accomplished by switching betweeen images as the game progresses.

# About the Theme

The project was put together during the 2018 Winter Olympics.  It was an obvious choice of interest at the time for the word content of a Hangman Game.
